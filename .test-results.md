## Summary

All test cases confirmed that the configuration hot reload functionality is working as expected. The ConfigManager class correctly implements the following features:

1. **Support for multiple configuration sources**: Global configuration, user configuration, project configuration
2. **Priority-based configuration merging**: Higher priority configurations take precedence
3. **File change monitoring**: Detection and automatic reload of configuration files when changed
4. **Error handling**: Safe processing even with invalid configuration files
5. **Platform-specific configuration**: Loading configurations according to the platform

Observations during testing:

1. Servers using STDIO transport with short-lived commands like echo disconnect immediately; using long-running commands makes testing easier
2. For change detection, the file content must actually change (overwriting with the same content is not detected)

Based on these results, we can conclude that the configuration hot reload functionality is working properly and meets the expected requirements.
