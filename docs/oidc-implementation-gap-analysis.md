# OIDC/OAuth2 Implementation Gap Analysis

This file documents discrepancies between the implementation (as of the latest `src/index.ts` and related code) and the requirements/checklist in `docs/oidc-oauth2-checklist.md`.

## Methodology
- Compared the checklist items (all phases) with the current implementation in `src/index.ts` and related files.
- Focused on authentication, user settings, lifecycle management, and API protection.
- Marked each item as "Implemented", "Partially Implemented", or "Not Implemented".
- Noted any missing features, incomplete tests, or documentation mismatches.

## Discrepancies

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] **Unit tests for authentication config**: Checklist says "not implemented" (unchecked). No evidence of unit tests for authentication config in the code.
- [ ] **Unit tests for JWT utilities**: Checklist says "not implemented" (unchecked). No evidence of JWT utility tests.

### Phase 1.5: MCP Lifecycle Management
- [x] All core lifecycle management features appear implemented in code and checklist.
- [ ] **Minimum privilege process execution**: Checklist marked as not implemented. No evidence in code of process isolation/minimum privilege execution for MCP servers.

### Phase 2: Provider Implementation
- [x] Google, Azure, GitHub, and generic OIDC providers are present and registered in code.
- [ ] **API tests for user config endpoints**: Checklist marked as not implemented. No evidence of API tests for user config endpoints.

### Phase 3: API Protection & RBAC
- [x] All route protection and RBAC middleware are present in code and checklist.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Session management**: Checklist items for session manager, Redis support, session logs, and expiry are not implemented.
- [ ] **User management**: Checklist items for user manager, user info cache, dynamic role API, and user activity logs are not implemented.
- [ ] **Token management**: Checklist items for token manager, refresh token support, token revocation, and token logs are not implemented.

### Security & Validation
- [ ] **Input validation with Zod**: Checklist marked as not implemented. No evidence of Zod-based request validation for API endpoints.
- [ ] **Sanitization and rate limiting**: Checklist marked as not implemented. Rate limiter middleware is present, but sanitization is not confirmed.

### Testing
- [ ] **Comprehensive tests**: Checklist marked as not implemented for JWT, PKCE, providers, middleware, and E2E tests. No evidence of these tests in code.

### Documentation
- [ ] **README, environment variable docs, provider setup examples**: Checklist marked as not implemented. README and docs may need updates.
- [ ] **API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)**: Not implemented.

### Deployment
- [ ] **Dockerfile and docker-compose updates for auth**: Checklist marked as not implemented. Docker files may need updates for OIDC/OAuth2 support.
- [ ] **Production environment checks (HTTPS, security validation, performance tests)**: Not implemented.

## Summary
- Most core authentication, provider, and RBAC logic is implemented.
- Major gaps remain in unit/E2E testing, advanced session/user/token management, input validation, documentation, and deployment hardening.
- See checklist for full details; this file highlights only the main discrepancies.
